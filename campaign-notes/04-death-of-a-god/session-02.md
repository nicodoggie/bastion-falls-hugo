A series of knocks on her room door woke Fai from her 3-hour rest. Mat, her
mentor and attendant priest told her that food was ready, and that they were to
depart soon. Travel to the Isle of the Gods had already been arranged by her
mother's Ahurikishki attendants--they were to join a caravan of traveling
merchants. The very same caravan that the mercenaries from the Pierced Wave, and
Troy Montague were to be a part of as well.

time rn)

Chian's people apparently hired the Band of the Hawk, led by a guy in long
golden hair and golden eyes.

Some old lady tried to sell corn to Fai, a kid tried to pick her pocket during
the transaction.

There was a stall selling jewelry depicting various religious iconography that
Fai had checked out. Aside from the typical Divine Masochist ones, there was a
9-pointed star of the [Arzhadad](/religions/arzhadad.md). The merchant described
it as a precursor to the [Church of the Divine
Masochist](/religions/divine-masochist.md). Mat explained that the Arzhadad
religion was, based on the works of the Giza Ahurian scholars of the day,
completely wiped out after a series of pogroms across the region after the Purha
and the Chetsi had consolidated control.

Fai, Mat and Chari entered an Apothecary and Flower Shop owned by the Maidenfeld
family. 
 
Fai sneaked away from Mat and Chari to see what exactly Troy was going to be
selling. Vegetables in one cart, boxes marked with labels of the Mirian Shipping
Company.   

Troy was trying to sweet-talk Prince Kolha without knowing who she really was.

They leave. Mother tells children about how succession works in the Ahurian
tradition.

They arrive at inn at 5 pm, settle down. Kolha is called to join the merchants. 

Fai pretends to use the bathroom, sneaks of to mercenary encampment. leaving an
unseen servant behind.

Mat and Chari looks for Fai. Unseen servant gives indication. Fai checks out the
Band of the Hawk, sees that blondie has a small black-purple orb. She casts
prestidigitation to see if the orb reacts. It did. She Thinks that perhaps
blondie is reformist. 

Kolha and the merchants talk shipping issues, ships en route to mainland Ahuria
disappear.

Fai returns to inn backyard, only to convince Mat and Chari to enter the
encampment. Fai tries to convince Mat to buy her a weapon.

They watch a mummers' show, while Fai sneaks of to check on weapons.

Fai convinces Mat to ask Band of the Hawk leader uncomfortable questions about
prostituting himself.

Fai and Chari pull a member of the Band of the Hawk named Creamy, and called
their group Band of the Big Birds, and said it was called that because they all
had "big birds". Fai casts "Friends" at him. They learn that the blondie leader
is called Gravy. 

Mat confirms Gravy's name. Also says that he was basically kicked out because of
some black-purple ball distressing the guy.

Mat buys Fai her whip. Fai steals a choker and some leather straps with a brass
buckle. 

Fai tries to find Troy's room, convinces Mat that it's important to do so. Troy
is not in room.

They are led to a different tavern/inn with a bent for anonymity and privacy.
They find Troy's bodyguard outside. Fai convinces Mat to distract bodyguard,
succeeds.

Fai enters the room, sees Troy with Ada, and Ada failing to be a good
dominatrix. Troy asks Ada to leave.

Fai orders Ada to stay as she takes Sorscha's face. She then acts like a
dominatrix again.

Learns that boxes contain luxury goods, cosmetics, Philter of the Living Dead,
Blackbane, boxes of arsenic.

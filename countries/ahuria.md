# Ahuria

The Ahurian Empire is a massive theocratic autocracy ruled by a lineage of
god-princes, who are both the secular and temporal centers of their
government. 

## Geography

Ahuria stretches across almost the entirety of the Beteran continent, with the
exception of its south eastern reaches barred by an insurmountable desert. In
addition, the Kolha region of Ahuria is on the Ralakan continent, to the east of
southern Poasah. The Ahurian mainland bordered to the east by the Sea of Giza, to the west by the
Sarham Sea, to the north, the Posaran Sea.

Ahuria has 12 administrative regions, one for each of the Twelve God-Princes of
the Ahore.

### Sorha

Sorha, the capital region of Ahuria and seat of the Ansou Ahoriyata, god-king of
all Ahuria, is northwestern-most region of Ahuria. The land is very resource
rich, with mountain-ranges filled with gemstones and metal ores; forests filled
with a variety of wildlife, and the Tears of the Gods, a gulf which is large and
deep enough to be a good naval base of operations.

The Yatamisahore, or the Palace on the isle of God is an island that houses the
capital city of the empire. The entire palace complex was built on the northern
foot of the Entrance to the Heavens, the sole mountain in the middle of the
island.

### Kolha

Kolha, one of the first lands conquered by the Ahurian Empire outside of the
Ralakan Continent. The Great Ahoriyata himself, along with his youngest child
had led the invasion force that took most of the South Central Kalassar, which
encompasses that is now known as Southern Poasah, Kolha, Ar, Mir,
Ralamba, Sarha, Sur and the Talamir Island.

After the fall of the Kalassarian Empire, the Kolhan princes have capitalized on
the chaos and had even sacked the City of Poasah itself. However, a coalition
mobilized by the Emperor in Bastion, had driven the Ahurian forces back,
settling close to Kolha's modern border with the Kingdom of Poasah.

After the death of Kolha XVIII, god-prince of Kolha Ahuria, a coalition formed by
his children refused to accept a new prince from the mainland. They were
convinced that one from the mainland could never truly understand the different
socio-political situation in the Kolhan lands, and their proximity to their
erstwhile foes. 

Kolha XVIII's seven children commissioned a grand fleet to form a blockade on the
Mirian shore to prevent the arrival of the newly ordained Kolha XIX. Mainland
Ahurian generals, however, found a solution by sending a fleet of privateer
ships with a mix of Ahurian soldiers deployed from Manascula. and a mercenary
force from Tanduaria and Nura. 

After 20 years of civil war, Kolha XIX was able to keep most of the northern
territory when he brokered a truce. Two of Kolha XVIII's children died during the
wars, but the remaining five portioned of the southern territories for
themselves, and formed individual states: Ar, Kalamba, Mir, Sarha and Sur.

The Mirian Islands were also taken by Ahuria, but due to its distance to Kolha,
administration of the islands was given to the governor of Giza, a position most
recently granted to the 13th ranking Ansa.

# Ahuria

The Ahurian Empire is a massive theocratic autocracy ruled by a lineage of
god-princes who are considered both the secular and temporal centers of their
government. 

## Geography

Ahuria stretches across almost the entirety of the Beteran continent, with the
exception of its south eastern reaches barred by an insurmountable desert. In
addition, the Kolha region of Ahuria is on the Ralakan continent, to the east of
southern Poasah. The Ahurian mainland bordered to the east by the Sea of Giza, to the west by the
Sarhaim Sea, to the north, the Posaran Sea.

Ahuria has 12 administrative regions, one for each of the Twelve God-Princes of
the Ahore.

### Sorha

Sorha, the capital region of Ahuria and seat of the Ansou Ahuriyata, god-king of
all Ahuria is northwestern-most region of Ahuria. The land is very resource
rich, with mountain-ranges filled with gemstones and metal ores; forests filled
with a variety of wildlife, and a gulf, which is large and deep enough to be a
good naval base of operations.

Mehicania is a country south of the Apgar Confederacy and was a group of states
within it. They were once part of the Confederacy, but seceded from it. The
Confederacy attempted to reverse the secession via military action, which then
prompted the Kingdom of Poasah to defend the fledgling nation. This prompted the
Apgarian-Poasan Conflict, which lasted from 1253 to 1255.

# The Death of a God

The King of Ahuria, afflicted with an unknown illness for about two years,
finally died. The kingdom mourns his passing.

A new king must now be crowned, and a Great Convocation of the Princes of the
Ahuriyata is to be held at the Palace in the Isle of the Gods. 

Sorha XVII, King of Ahuria is dead. Long live Sorha XVIII, whosoever they may
be. 

It is said that whenever a Grand Convocation is held, the King chooses a handful
of devout and worthy Princes to join him in his journey into the Great Beyond--a
place of eternal and everlasting peace, finally free from the Wheel of
Suffering. So although the next in line, holder of the title of Prince
Turha, ought to become the next Sorha the Ahurian world yet await the identity
of their next ruler.

Not all the Princes of the Ansa Ahuriyata wish to be King, however, none so
apprehensive is the Prince Kolha XIX. Not only does she fear for the newly-won
peace of her princedom, she also dreads the repressed bloodlust of the Gods of
the Ahurian people--her own brothers and sisters who would kill to gain power.

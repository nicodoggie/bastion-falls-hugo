## Number System

The Ahurian language, though currently uses a base-10 number system, it seems to
have once been a base-12 one, Theologists theorize that the number 12 was used
because of the religious significance, but Linguists think otherwise. Perhaps,
according to them, 12 was used by the Great Ahuriyata as a symbol of a
completeness. They think that the Tongue of the Ancients had this base-12 system
before the Great Ahuriyata came to eminence already.

| #  | Ordinal |
| -- | --      |
| 0  | Pono    |
| 1  | Ture    |
| 2  | Sina    |
| 3  | Chora   |
| 4  | Weti    |
| 5  | Rena    |
| 6  | Hiso    |
| 7  | Susu    |
| 8  | Si      |
| 9  | Hiti    |
| 10 | Pasa    |
| 11 | Tosa    |
| 12 | Gora    |
| 100 | Yosana |
| 1000 | Kirome |
| 1000000 | Yahiya | 
| 10^9    | Tuhiya |
| 10^12   | Sihiya |
| 10^15   | Chohiya |

Next numbers would be a compound of the larger place, a place marker, followed by the lower
place, but only with the digits 1-10. Only when we get to the 100's do we still
use 11 and 12. It the least significant digit is a zero, then it is not verbalized.

For example:

```
21 = Sina (2) . Pa (tens place marker) . Ture (1) = Sinapature
24 = Sina . Pa . Weti = Sinapaweti
77 = Susu . Pa . Susu = Susupasusu
100 = Yosana
110 = Tosa . Yo (hundreds place marker) = Tosayo 
111 = Tosa . Yo . Ture = Tosayoture
```

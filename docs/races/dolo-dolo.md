# Dolo-Dolo

The Dolo-Dolo are a race of magically-enhanced humanoids found primarily in the Forest region of Sorha, but
do exist elsewhere in the [Ralakan continent(/continents/ralaka). They are an intelligent, but highly traditional 
and ritualistic people whose lives revolve around the protection and stabilization of their tribes. There are said 
to be 7 main tribes in power within the Forest region of Sorha, and have a cultural divide that is, as delineated
by many of the Dolo-Dolo themselves, as the Eastern and Western tribes. These groupings are defined by 
which side of the [Stairway to the Heavens](/places/stairway-to-the-heavens) their ancestral lands lie upon.

Historical references to the Dolo-Dolo were put in question by many modern scholars of Ahurian history prior to the 
Fall of Burtz. They surmise that most of these histories and records were semi-mythical, whose sources were colored
by a certain historiographical tradition that ascribed unexplained events or perceptions to popular theological references.
In these cases, historians believed that Dolo-Dolo sightings were used to explain strange sightings within forest regions
due to the popularity of the [Tale of the Great Ahuriyata nad the Dolo-Dolo Trickster](). They offer as proof the virtual
disappearance of Dolo-Dolo sightings and references after 700 Ai. Of course, recent events around the world, where peoples once
considered mythological have begun to surface, especially actual tribes in Sorha who call themselves the Dolo-Dolo have renewed
interest in re-examining these histories and called into question the historiographical theories on the subject.

## Mythology
### Ahurian Tradition

Most Ahurians have only heard of the Dolo-Dolo through the Tale of the Great Ahuriyata and the Dolo-Dolo Trickster.
Some variations of the tale exist, as it was conveyed orally by many a tavern performer within Ahuria's centuries
of dominance in the Ralakan continent. It tells the story of how the Great Ahuriyata had first travelled through the 
Forests of Sorha in search of the mountain the Stairway to the Heavens would eventually be founded upon. WIthin
that forest, there was a mysterious creature that seemed to stalk the Great Ahuriyata, with the intention of 
eating him for dinner. 

The Great Ahuriyata, of course, was too cunning himself, and was too wily for the Dolo-Dolo's
trickery, and was, instead able to fool him. However, when the Great Ahuriyata was about to leave the forest,
the Dolo-Dolo was caught in a monster's snare. The Great Ahuriyata saves him from his plight, Extremely grateful
for the kindness that he was showed even after the Dolo-Dolo's attempt at trickery, he pledged his everlasting
support to the Ahuriyata and his kin.

### Dolomite Tradition

The Dolo-Dolo of Sorha have a similar tale that is passed down from generation, but the trickery is played out by 
the adversary of the Dolo-Dolo religion--Herasi the Deceitful. Herasi was a spiteful character that did ill to 
random individuals who may have entered, supposedly without permission, in land that he wrongfully claims as his.
So as the Great Ahuriyata entered the Forest of the Dolo-Dolo, Herasi takes the face of a Dolo-Dolo female in
distress to lure the renowned hero into a trap.

The Ahuriyata falls for the deception after a very convincing performance. Before Herasi was able to land the final
blow however, a Dolo-Dolo tribesman and his child stumbled upon the scene. With their> spears, they drove the 
Deceitful One away. 

Now the Dolo-Dolo tribesman, whose name and lineage differ depending upon the tribe telling the tales, came from
an impoverished tribe on the brink of starvation due to a famine induced by the very same Herasi. They feared that
Herasi would now punish them even more after exposing his true form the the erstwhile interloper that entered 
the Deceitful One's territory. The Ahuriyata, grateful from the help he just received, and angry for the suffering
that Herasi had set upon these good people, decided to help them thwart the Deceitful One once and for all.

They enact an elaborate plan to lure Herasi into their encampment, offering a young face and form that suits the
trickster's preference. His current body was at this point turning quite old and frail, so the replacement was
a welcome one. Unbeknown to Herasi, the Great Ahuriyata was already lying in wait by the time he entered the 
young man's home. The Great Ahuriyata then springs into action and reveals his trap--a gigantic black-green orb
that is capable of binding creatures of magic such as he within it; To this day, this giant, yet seemingly inert 
Attractor, sits dormant underneath the Dolomite Mountains. 

Some traditions surmise that once the Mother of Orbs escapes its prison, it would allow the sphere they call the
Orb of Binding to feed upon that larger, more directed source of magic and free Herasi to commit his crimes once more.

## History

Evidence suggests that the Dolo-Dolo were the first settlers of the Ralakan Continent. Earliest fossils of
Dolo-Dolo settlements were found in the Purha region. Within 100,000 years, they would have populated regions 
up to Pise.

Fragments of Kureran thought-records excavated from Mehicania date some of the earliest interactions with the Dolo-Dolo
at present-day Sorha went back to at least 950 PF. The recording was of an explorer following one of the rivers, possibly

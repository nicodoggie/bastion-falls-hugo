# The Church of the Divine Masochist

One of the major religions of the countries spawned by the former Kalasarian
Empire, the Church of the Divine Masochist's ultimate origin is from a religion
primarily worshiped in a small settlement in an island off the coast of Giza.

That religion, now unknown, had believed that a great theo-political leader
from their people would rise to take the reins of government from the oppressive
Kalasarian regime and free them from their yoke. They rallied around an
influential political figure said to be descended from a lost
religiously-important lineage, who they believed was the "one appointed by God".

The man, however, was unceremoniously imprisoned by the Kalasarian governor and
was scheduled to be whipped to death within a week after his capture. The
governor's daughter, however, fell in love with the man. She pleaded with her
father to release him to her as a slave.
